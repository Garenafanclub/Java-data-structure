# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

A collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** solutions written in **Java**.  
This repository is my personal DSA practice log, containing solutions from platforms such as **LeetCode**, **GeeksForGeeks**, and other interview problem sets.

The main aim is to improve **problem-solving skills**, write **clean and optimized code**, and build strong foundational understanding of **core algorithmic concepts**.
